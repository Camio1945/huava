# v.0.2.1 - Target

1. Deprecate the [old fronted](https://github.com/Camio1945/huava-vue3-deprecated) , because its features and example is not enough. For example, the menus are fixed on the frontend code, but not  dynamically get from the backend. 

2. Write new frontend, based on [likeadmin](https://github.com/likeshop-github/likeadmin_php/tree/master/admin).

3. Add permission checking. See `UriAuthFilter.java`.
