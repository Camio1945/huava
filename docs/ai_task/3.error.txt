Write test for src/main/java/cn/huava/sys/cache/UserCache.java:
1. Every test method's name should start with `should_`, use underscore style.
2. Use assertj(org.assertj.core.api.Assertions) instead of junit to set assertions.
3. Cover every method, every line, every instruction, every branch.
4. The test class should not be public.
5. Add at least one assertion to each test case, if there is nothing to assert, use `verify()`.
6. The author of the new file should be Camio1945.
7. Each class need a separate test file.

This line `return userExtPo == null ? null : userExtPo.getId().toString();` as reported: 1 of 2 branches missed
fix it


Edit src/test/java/cn/huava/sys/cache/UserCacheTest.java, write test for src/main/java/cn/huava/sys/cache/UserCache.java:
1. Every test method's name should start with `should_`, use underscore style.
2. Use assertj(org.assertj.core.api.Assertions) instead of junit to set assertions.
3. Cover every method, every line, every instruction, every branch.
4. The test class should not be public.
5. Add at least one assertion to each test case, if there is nothing to assert, use `verify()`.
6. Don't use @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
7. Keep the `extends WithSpringBootTestAnnotation` part.

When I remove src/test/java/cn/huava/sys/cache/UserCacheTest.java, and then run `mvn clean verify`, all tests pass.
When I remain src/test/java/cn/huava/sys/cache/UserCacheTest.java, and the run the src/test/java/cn/huava/sys/cache/UserCacheTest.java itself, it passes too.
But when I remain src/test/java/cn/huava/sys/cache/UserCacheTest.java, then run `mvn clean verify`, the test stuck, why is that?
Just answer the question, don't change any code.
Don't guess, analyze the code and find the accurate reason.
