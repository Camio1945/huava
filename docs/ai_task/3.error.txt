Edit src/main/java/cn/huava/common/config/RedisConfig.java:
1. Add @NullMarked for class, if the class has @Slf4j annotation, put @NullMarked under @Slf4j.
2. Since the class has @NullMarked now, the parameters or return values which are not marked as @NonNull (lombok.NonNull) before should be marked as @Nullable (org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable) now. If it already marked as @Nullable, ignore it.
3. Remove lombok.NonNull importing, and then remove the @NonNull from the code.
4. If the class has inner classes, do the same for the inner classes.
