Write tests for src/main/java/cn/huava/sys/service/user/RefreshTokenService.java:
1. Every test method's name should start with `should_`, use underscore style, no camelcase at all.
2. Use assertj(org.assertj.core.api.Assertions) instead of junit to set assertions.
3. Cover every method, every line, every instruction, every branch.
4. Add at least one assertion to each test case, if there is nothing to assert, use `verify()`.
5. The test class should not be public.
6. The author of the new file should be Camio1945.
7. Each class need a separate test file.
8. Give priority to `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)` over `extends WithSpringBootTestAnnotation`.

Edit src/test/java/cn/huava/common/util/LoginUtilTest.java, cover this line:
Assert.isTrue(userExtPo != null, "用户名或密码错误");
