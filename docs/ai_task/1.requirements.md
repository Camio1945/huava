- I need to compile this project to a native image.
- I want all methods work in native image. This time, let's focus on the CaptchaController.
- Don't change the code in src/main/java/cn/huava/common/controller/CaptchaController.java.
- Use this command to generate native image:
  ./mvnw -Pnative clean native:compile -DskipTests
- Use this command to kill the native image process:
  pkill -9 huava
- Use this command to run native image:
  nohup ./target/huava --server.port=34567 > huava.log 2>&1 &
- Use this command to check the url:
  curl http://localhost:34567/captcha
- Do the compile -> pkill -> run -> check -> edit -> compile loop until you get the correct result.
