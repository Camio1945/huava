Based on my investigation, I've found the reason why `refreshTokenPo` is null in the `LogoutService.java` during the test cleanup:

The issue occurs because of the `@Transactional` and `@Rollback` annotations on the `UserControllerTest` class. Here's what happens:

1. During test execution, when login occurs, the `LoginService` saves the refresh token to the database via `AceRefreshTokenService.saveRefreshToken()`.

2. The `@Transactional` annotation ensures all database operations happen within a transaction, and `@Rollback` ensures that all changes are rolled back after each test method completes.

3. When `@AfterAll` executes (which calls `ApiTestUtil.logout()`), the transaction containing the refresh token has already been rolled back, so the refresh token no longer exists in the database.

4. When `LogoutService.logout()` tries to find the refresh token using `aceRefreshTokenService.getByRefreshToken(refreshToken)`, it returns `null` because the token was removed from the database due to the transaction rollback.

5. This causes `refreshTokenPo` to be `null`, preventing the logout operation from completing properly.

The `@Rollback` annotation at the class level causes all database changes made during the test execution to be reverted before the `@AfterAll` method runs, which is why the refresh token that was saved during login is no longer present when the logout operation attempts to find and delete it.
